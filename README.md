Hi there!

Here are some links to my works, which I've developed during the EPAM FE Internal courses.

1. <b>React router training app:</b> <a href="https://austdm.github.io">LINK.</a></br>
It's not a good idea to use gh pages for routing, but anyway, who cares ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

2. <b>Pure JS form validation with some features:</b> <a href="https://austdm.github.io/internalCourse-form_validation/">LINK.</a></br>
Btw checkout my awesome roundabout - no copy-paste/libs.

3. <b>Adaptive layout Raccoon blog:</b> <a href="https://austdm.github.io/adaptive_layout/">LINK.</a></br>
LESS+JS. Resize to have fun. There are some active menus in portable & mobile modes, </br>
active social links - click to like.
