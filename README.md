Hi there!

Here are some links to my works, implemented during the EPAM FE Internal courses.

1. React router training app: <a href="https://austdm.github.io">LINK.</a></br>
It's not a good idea to use gh pages for routing, but anyway, who cares ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

2. Pure JS form validation with some features: <a href="https://austdm.github.io/internalCourse-form_validation/">LINK.</a></br>
